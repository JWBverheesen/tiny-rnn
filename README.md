========

TinyRNN is a lightweight **header-only C++11 library** for building **deep recurrent neural networks** of any architecture from multilayered perceptrons to [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)-like RNN's.

Upd. 11.03.2017: TinyRNN is a self-education project and is no longer being maintained.

TinyRNN is heavily influenced by [synaptic.js](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic), a javascript library by [Juan Cazala](http://juancazala.com/) based on the paper by Derek D. Monner and James A. Reggia -- ["A generalized LSTM-like training algorithm for second-order recurrent neural networks"](http://www.overcomplete.net/papers/nn2012.pdf).
